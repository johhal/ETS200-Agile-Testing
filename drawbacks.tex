In general TDD has been praised for it's advantages, described in section~\ref{benefits}, but of course it has it's drawbacks.\\

\noindent In this section a drawback will be:
\begin{itemize}
\item an increased production cost, or
\item a decreased code quality, as defined in section~\ref{quality}.
\end{itemize}

According to George \& Williams ~\cite{georgeandwilliams} there are several shortcommings in TDD that may result in a lower code quality and/or increase the production time, and therefore the production cost:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{Lack of Design} - Often TDD doesn't include an upfront design but rather an ad hoc design approach which could lead to unnecessary refactorisation and re-designing. 
 \item \textit{Applicability of practice} - Certain functionalities, such as GUI's, are difficult to test and alot of time will be wasted on writing mock objects.
 \item \textit{Reliance on refactoring} - Since no upfront design is made and mock objects are used much effort will be spent on refactorisation.
 \item \textit{Skill level} - It takes good skill and discipline with the developers to incorporate TDD into their natural workflow. An unexperienced programmer may not be able to write adequate tests.\\
\end{itemize}

\noindent It is well-recognized that TDD decreases the programming speed and according to ~\cite{microsoftibm} TDD may increase the development time by up to 30\%. 
And according to the study,~\cite{tddroi} is 30\% the rate at which defects are adjusted must be increased by at least 20\% to be beneficial when using TDD.
