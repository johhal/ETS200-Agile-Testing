As reflected by Janzen and Saiedian in~\cite{janzen2}, traditional software development involves quite complex parts as, e.g, different processes, technologies and tools and often software projects are unable to meet their budgets and schedule. Thus, there is a growing demand for new techniques to improve speed, economics and quality aspects in software development, and here TDD combined with XP would be a good candidate. Still, Janzen and Saiedian,~\cite{janzen2}, states that it takes between five and fifteen years for the industry to adopt the methods of the academic practitioners and, thus, the use of TDD will probably increase in the future.
